> REAL BOTANICAL MATERIAL · RECTANGULAR FIELD · NATURAL CROSSING · MINIMAL BLACK LINE · EDITORIAL WHITESPACE

XXD Panel 030 is an image-generation Skill for Codex and compatible agents. It preserves the photograph's identity, proportion, contour flow, pose, direction, action, and relation, then rebuilds the subject from visibly real leaves, petals, twigs, fruit, seeds, grass stems, bark, or dried foliage.

The materials keep their native contours, veins, fibres, translucency, colour difference, curl, tears, and irregular edges. One simple source-harmonised rectangular colour or paper field establishes order without a complete border; most of the subject stays inside while one source-earned directional part grows naturally beyond it. Generous whitespace, incomplete symmetry, almost no black line, and lightweight editorial copy balance organic accident with graphic discipline.

## Why it exists

“Leaf collage” easily collapses into children's craft, a stock floral arrangement, neatly clipped plant geometry, or arbitrary decoration mistaken for natural intelligence.

030 reverses that logic:

```text
lock identity / proportion / gesture / relation → choose real natural forms that can carry specific source cues → preserve their uncut material evidence → establish one source-harmonised rectangular field without a full border → keep most of the subject inside → let one genuinely directional part grow beyond it → balance incomplete symmetry and generous whitespace → add only functional black marks and lightweight editorial copy
```

If an unrelated photograph could replace the source without materially changing material choice, subject contour, gesture, rectangular-field relation, natural crossing, colour character, or type alignment, the result is not 030.

## The 030 visual contract

- **Source identity:** at least three specific cues preserve proportion, contour flow, pose, direction, action, function, and relation.
- **Source identity:** at least three specific cues preserve proportion, contour flow, pose, direction, action, function, and relation.
- **Actual natural forms:** leaves, petals, twigs, fruit, seeds, grasses, bark, and dried foliage remain visibly real; their native edges and textures build the subject rather than fill a drawn outline.
- **One rectangular field:** source-harmonised colour and implied edges create order without deliberately drawing all four sides.
- **Source-earned crossing:** most of the subject stays within the field; only a small directional part crosses because the original action or contour calls for it.
- **Almost no black line:** a fine hand mark may supply an eye, expression, connector, action cue, or rhythm, but never encloses the subject.
- **Organic editorial balance:** credible flat-surface overlap, incomplete symmetry, clear weight, pale ground, and generous whitespace keep the work alive yet restrained.
- **Lightweight copy:** one concise title and only useful micro-notes align with a field edge, open paper, or one twig, stem, or leaf direction.

These samples demonstrate the 030 aesthetic motive. Their subjects, composition, palette, copy, and earlier canvas ratio never become generation references or current defaults.

## The original brief is authoritative

`references/030-source.md` is this project's sole creative and aesthetic authority. The Skill no longer summarizes or expands it, and it does not impose a shared palette, colour plan, aesthetic motive, title, or microcopy package. GPT Image 2 follows that brief's own rules for colour, material, composition, whitespace, wording, and typography.

Mode and size completely replace the legacy 3:4 top-bottom delivery container without rewriting the transformation aesthetic. Each asset sends GPT Image 2 one selected mode's final contract instead of asking it to interpret four alternatives inside a generic template.

## Four combinable output modes

Select one or more of `top-bottom`, `left-right`, `design-only`, and `wallpaper-pack`. When several are selected, each is generated independently with its own prompt.

- `top-bottom`: one complete canvas with the reality view above and transformed design below.
- `left-right`: one complete canvas whose left-right structure runs from top edge to bottom edge, source left and design right. Typography stays inside that structure rather than creating a shared third footer; widths may be asymmetric.
- `design-only`: the source is a non-visible reference for identity, structure, colour logic, and facts; every visible element follows this Panel's transformation language.
- `wallpaper-pack`: each device receives an independently composed full-canvas transformed wallpaper, with no source-photo region.

There is no seam, midpoint-percentage, or pixel-coordinate test. Deterministic assembly is used only when the user explicitly requests exact panel geometry or pixel-identical source preservation.

Ordinary sizes are also multi-select: auto-fit, source aspect, 1:1, 3:4, 4:3, 4:5, 5:4, 2:3, 3:2, 9:16, 16:9, 21:9, 5:7, 7:5, or custom ratios/exact pixels. There is no silent default. Every distinct aspect is independently recomposed from the same verbatim source brief.

Wallpaper packs may be linked or independent. A linked pack creates one anchor image, then recomposes each remaining device from the original source plus that anchor; it never crops one image into four sizes.

## Text modes

Before generation, resolve one of three choices:

1. **Model generates text from the original prompt**: the user supplies only the language or locale; GPT Image 2 follows the source brief's wording, amount, tone, and typography logic. Every word arises from the current image's content, atmosphere, or implied meaning, and anything presented as factual or documentary information must be grounded in supplied, visible, or verified facts.
2. **Use my exact text**: pass it verbatim, without rewriting, translating, or adding a title; typography still follows the source brief.
3. **No text**: prohibit visible text and pseudo-text.

The outer Skill no longer pre-writes titles, microcopy, or copy packages. Output language is resolved separately from the interface language and is never guessed from a person, scene, or filename.

## Complete-canvas first, raster-only delivery

The image model owns the aesthetics of the entire finished composition; paired layouts also default to one complete-canvas generation. `scripts/compose_panel.py` remains only for condition-based recovery, lossless pixel calibration, and read-only audit. It is not run pre-emptively and does not judge aesthetic success.

Every deliverable is a raster PNG and every invocation creates a fresh task under `~/Desktop/xxd/`. The configured image route exposes sanitised status only—never providers, endpoints, credentials, headers, prompts, responses, or account details. SVG, HTML, Canvas, diagrams, and programmatic drawing are not substitutes for the final artwork.

## Capability-adaptive questions and inline parameters

The same Skill adapts to the host's real interaction capabilities and never presents decorative symbols as clickable controls:

- **When Claude Code exposes `AskUserQuestion + multiSelect: true`**: modes and sizes use genuine checkboxes; text mode and wallpaper relationship use single-select. Common sizes are grouped into square, portrait, and landscape checkbox questions, selections accumulate across groups, and custom sizes use free input.
- **When Codex exposes only `request_user_input`**: use it only for mutually exclusive fields such as text mode and wallpaper relationship. Do not misrepresent modes or sizes as single-choice; collect them through clear combination input.
- **With no interactive question tool**: use two typed rounds—modes first, then sizes plus text. Never draw fake `- [ ]` boxes or ask the user to switch to Plan mode merely to obtain a form.

The second round initially shows only Smart recommendation, Source aspect, Common ratios, and Custom. Expand the full library only when requested: square `1:1`; portrait `3:4, 4:5, 2:3, 9:16, 5:7`; landscape `4:3, 5:4, 3:2, 16:9, 21:9, 7:5`. Any ratios may be combined, and exact pixels are always accepted.

All settings can also be passed inline:

```text
/xxd-panel-030 photo.jpg --mode top-bottom,design-only --size auto,3:4,9:16 --text prompt --locale ja-JP
```

Supported parameters are `--mode`, repeatable or comma-separated `--size`, `--text prompt|exact|none`, `--locale`, `--copy`, `--wallpaper linked|independent`, `--wallpaper-size`, and `--out`. Complete parameters skip preflight; partial parameters trigger only missing questions.

## Image-model priority

GPT Image 2 is the default first choice. It keeps this project's established workflow: high-fidelity source reference, explicit whole-canvas selection before generation, one complete-canvas generation for paired modes, and scripted composition only as a conditional fallback.

Seedance 5.0 Pro, Nano Banana Pro (Gemini Image Pro), Nano Banana 2 (Gemini Image Flash), or another compatible bitmap model may also be used when it is actually available through the current tools or configured routes and can satisfy source fidelity, whole-canvas ratio, target-language text, and linked-wallpaper multi-reference requirements. An alternative changes only the generation route; it must not change modes, canvas, copy, locale, wallpaper relationship, or the complete-canvas-first strategy.

If no suitable route is available, the Skill asks the user to enable an image-generation tool or provide an API key. User-provided credentials may be used for the current task without being echoed, displayed, logged, or exposed. They are not persisted, and provider, account, billing, or global route configuration is not modified, unless the user explicitly requests that configuration change.

## Get started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nevertoday/xxd-panel-030.git
mkdir -p ~/.codex/skills
ln -s "$(pwd)/xxd-panel-030" ~/.codex/skills/xxd-panel-030
```

Claude Code users may link the same directory to `~/.claude/skills/xxd-panel-030`. Restart the agent session after installation.

```text
$xxd-panel-030
Turn this photograph into a left-right composition. Derive the copy from the image and write it in natural Korean.
```

You may invoke the Skill with only a photograph. It first asks for one or more modes in a numbered multiline menu, then for copy settings; wallpaper mode also asks for linked/independent continuity and device sizes.

Full specifications:

- [Skill workflow](SKILL.md)
- [Chinese runtime adapter](references/xxd-panel-030-prompt.zh-CN.md)
- [English runtime adapter](references/xxd-panel-030-prompt.en.md)
- [Original style brief](references/030-source.md)

## Boundaries and trust

- Each photograph stays within its own task and never borrows subjects, colours, copy, or composition from other inputs, old results, or samples.
- Every invocation creates a fresh task directory; even identical sources and parameters must generate anew.
- Deliverables are PNG bitmaps, never SVG, HTML, Canvas, or programmatic-drawing substitutes.
- The configured bitmap bridge emits sanitised status only and does not expose providers, endpoints, headers, credentials, prompts, or response bodies.
- Each selected ordinary mode returns one file; selected `wallpaper-pack` adds four separate wallpapers. `all` returns seven PNGs per source across four sibling mode directories, never a contact sheet or overview.

Local composition needs Python 3 and Pillow. The safe bitmap bridge uses Python 3.11+ `tomllib`. Image generation still requires a host agent with built-in raster generation or an already configured compatible raster route.
